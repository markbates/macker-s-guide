<% page_title "Testing Framework"%>

<p>
  When a new Mack application is generated, its testing framework is default to <code>RSpec</code>. If you prefer, you could generate your application and set the testing framework to the <code>Test::Unit::TestCase</code>, by doing:</code>.
</p>

<% code(:cl) do -%>
$ mack my_new_application -t test_case
<% end -%>

<p>
  To run the test suite of your application, all you have to do is run the rake command from the root of your application.  Let's see some example: (assuming that we're using the default test framework, rspec)
  
<% code do -%>
# generate a new mack app
$ mack foo

# go into the newly generated app directory
$ cd foo

# run the test suite
$ rake

# and you should see the following result:
