<p>The default session store for Mack applications is <code>Mack::SessionStore::Cookie</code>. This uses encrypted cookies to store the session. If the session cookie can't be decrypted it will be deleted and a new session will be started.</p>

<p>There are 3 parameters that govern sessions as a whole in Mack, and one one that governs the cookie session store.</p>

# your application.
